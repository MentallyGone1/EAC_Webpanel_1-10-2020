Toxicity through cheating and griefing was a growing thing in games and there were no reputable prevention solutions out there. Through a lot of hard work and great partnerships, we built Easy Anti-Cheat, the leading anti-cheat service on the market. We’d like to thank you for allowing us to play our small part in your games!",

We rebranded Easy Anti-Cheat to Kamu and started building new tools to support the live management of player satisfaction, and to help developers identify player needs as quickly as they emerge. This year we released “Community Connect” into open beta, a service to hear and support your players. In addition, we started building “Gameplay Data”, a telemetry service to reveal the features your players love most.",

Epic Games is a company that we’ve always respected, and just like us, exist for the love of games. Epic introduced the opportunity to offer our services as part of Unreal Engine, while keeping our services available to all developers, regardless of engine. This opportunity is everything we stand for, to help as many developers as possible with the incredible games that we love to play.",

Every one of us at Kamu would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the journey so far. We look forward to building more awesome services and helping you manage the great games you build today, tomorrow and in the future.",
